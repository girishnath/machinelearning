# Comparing Classifiers

In this practical application, the performance of 4 classifiers were compared. The classifiers were Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Trees.

The dataset is from a Porugese bank's marketing efforts. 

## Business Objective

The business objective is to improve the effectiveness of the bank's marketing efforts, thereby reducing human and technology costs. The effectiveness of a marketing campaign may be defined as the percentage of customers who start a term deposit as a result of the campaign. To achieve said effectiveness, we would want to build a model that can classify customers based on their probability to convert.

## Baseline

The accuracy score of the baseline was determined to be 88.7
