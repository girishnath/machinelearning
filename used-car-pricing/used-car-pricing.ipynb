The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GOY73kgjmMq3"},"source":["### CRISP-DM Framework\n","\n","\n","To frame the task, throughout our practical applications we will refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM.

Identify the right price to set for a used car in their inventory\n","2.   Stock cars in inventory that are likely to sell\n","\n","With this information, the business objectives of this task, or the outputs, can be understood as:\n","\n","*   (Primary) Given the attributes of an automobile, identify the features that are a good predictor of the price at which it will sell\n","*   (Secondary) Given the attributes of an automobile, predict the price it will sell for\n","*   (Future) Identify the features that contribute most to the sale of a used car. In other words, given the attributes of a customer and an automobile, what attributes are a good predictor of a used car sale? Since the provided dataset does not have enough information to predict this outcome, this can be treated as future work.\n","\n","#### Situation Assessment\n","The major risks and constraints associated with this task are:\n","\n","\n","*   The quality of the dataset might affect the outcome. This can be mitigated to an extent using train/test data splits\n","*   There could be new factors affecting the price of a used car (for example: market conditions, pandemic) which could impact the applicability of our prediction to the client.\n","*   The time available to complete this task is only 1 week, which is a major constraint.\n","\n","#### Data Mining Goals\n","\n","The goal of this task is to follow the CRISP-DM framework to deliver a README.md and Jupyter notebook of the analysis.
